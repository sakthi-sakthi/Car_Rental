                <p class="text-justify">Things to do: A high percentage of people who rent cars are visitors from other places which means that their knowledge of the local activities will be limited. They might be in town for some work, or they might be just passing through. Either way, they will want to know about the local attractions and the activities they can take part in to kill time. If your website can provide trustworthy information along with the provision to rent a car, then they will associate your site and consequently your business as something helpful and useful at the same time. This will lead to better reviews and testimonials and will increase the number of returning customers which forms the crux of any successful business. You could write about the things a visitor can do like attend a local carnival, festival, open-air theatre.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Places to visit: This is another avenue where you can provide a lot of high-quality information. Suppose a person is on a business trip and has a few hours of free time. They would love to spend that time by visiting all the local attractions. It can be anything from a lighthouse to a local museum. Provide an updated list of places they can visit in a particular locality as well as the specialties of that place. Again, if they end up enjoying the visit, the enjoyment will be on you which the customers will reward back with more business. Another way this will boost your business is that it opens up a whole new source of customers. People might be directed to your blog while looking for the local attractions and that can be how they end up discovering your business.Add beautiful photographs if possible for each place.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Driving Laws and regulations: It is always the little things that can make all the difference between a great trip and a forgettable one. People will be grateful if you can keep them out of trouble. That is what you will be doing by providing a guideline to all the local driving laws. These can include the speed limits in places, the carpool lane laws, overtaking and lane-changing laws, towing and RV regulations, and the validity of driving licenses from other areas.

You could make this as a regular blog post or as an FAQ section using VEVS' features. The point is that people will feel reassured after reading blog posts of this kind and that will help them get the feeling that apart from just providing them with a car, you are looking out for them. This will compel them to think of only your website whenever they need to rent a car in the future.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Fuel prices: Not all places sell fuel at the same price. Finding the fuel prices for a particular area can be quite easy, but this is a section that involves a lot of active work. As the fuel price can change on a daily basis, you need to make sure to update this section constantly. Also, mention the date and time that the fuel price you listed is from.

Such a section will help people to calculate the overall cost of the trip and thus plan their travels even better and who do they have to thank for it? Yes! Your website. Again, this is not something that many car rental websites will offer which will make your site stand out from the sea of car rental services.Another thing that can get under the skin of people renting cars is finding a decent parking spot. Finding great parking spots that do not charge exorbitant prices can become a demanding chore.</p>
